# Dead fork of oidc-token-manager

I suggested a fix/enhancement IdentityModel/oidc-token-manager#12 and tested some thoughts out.
I made my changes on master (because I didn't know what I was doing...) so I'm leaving this.

# oidc-token-manager

Library to manage tokens obtained via OpenID Connect (OIDC)

## Install
To install you can either get the oidc-client via bower, via the dist folder in this repo, or you can clone this repo and run gulp yourself.

As of now, there are not really any docs (sorry), but there are some samples in this repo.
